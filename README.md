Howdy! 👋
==========

I am Andrei, web-developer. The Bachelor of Computer Science, have commercial IT experience from 2016 ↗️.
Most of this time I use Python (Django, FastAPI), but also did fun automatizations with VBA, C++, Arduino.

Currently work with high-loaded web-services + microservices and different bots (Telegram, Slack).

Programming is my passion 🤪 and the reason why you can see a lot of repos here ⬇.

###### P.S.: i'm not in Singapore, yet.
